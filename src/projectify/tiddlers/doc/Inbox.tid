Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

The first step to get organized is to get everything out of your head.
The [[Inbox|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/ui/inbox/Inbox]] is a special
[[Project|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/doc/Projects]] where thoughts are captured
so you don't forget them, and can get them out of your head quickly.

[[Todos|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/doc/Todos]] in the [[Inbox|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/ui/inbox/Inbox]]
can then be [[refiled|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/doc/Refiling]] into projects and/or [[scheduled|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/doc/Schedule]].

Projectify also provides a simple way to [[quickly capture|$:/plugins/nico/projectify/doc/QuickCapture]] tasks into the Inbox.
